We all terrified by the rules, 

Too afraid to do anything when we are in love, too afraid. 

He is drunk tonight, 

Restless with the joy of hometown. 


<br/>

Maybe you know you don't feel anything, 

But please don't leave, don't leave me alone. 

Once you whisper to me at night, 

Your mind would be at peace. 

I want to open my eyes, open. 

The river seems to be moving. 

<br/>

I am finally waking up, waking up. 

But I seemed to be forgotten. 

I want to open my eyes, open. 

The river seems to be moving. 

<br/>

You need to speak it out loud, out loud. 

Don't let things rotten in your mind. 

Please don't leave, don't leave me alone. 

You have said forever to me. 

<br/>

Pain is growing, 

They made up the untamed river.
