Hi, you forgot the raspy windswept air,  

Hi, you believed life could be lived without care.  

Why do you want to sing when you see snow?  

Why do you drop tears when you let go?  

<br/>

They passed by one by one,  

You missed them one by one,  

You did it again and again,  

And you give up again and again,  

You laughed, you screamed,  

All the memories hurt, it seems,  

Because I enjoyed how beautiful it was,  

Because I tolerated the rotten cause.  

<br/>

You said you won't love but still linger near,  

So you see life,  

It's as bitter as the song you hear.  

Because we enjoyed how beautiful it was,  

Because we tolerated the rotten cause.  

<br/>

Hi, you slept but time is still running fast,  

Hi, you woke from nightmares to see the past.  

I know you would hold the candle and wait for me,  

In the darkest nights, faithfully.  

You were crushed when the familiar whisper came,  

Reminding you of what we once became.  

<br/>

They walked away one by one,  

You missed them one by one,  

You did it again and again,  

And you give up again and again,  

You laughed, you screamed,  

All the memories hurt, it seems,  

Because I enjoyed how beautiful it was,  

Because I tolerated the rotten cause.  

<br/>

You said you won't love but still linger near,  

So you see life,  

It's as bitter as the song you hear.  

Do you want to see flower beds in bloom?  

Do you want to see swallows return home?  

If none of them come back to stay,  

Who should I live for, day by day?  

<br/>

Because I enjoyed how beautiful it was,  

Because I tolerated the rotten cause.  

<br/>

You said don't chase but you don't want to quit,  

So you know,  

Life is as bitter as the song you sing.  

<br/>

What are you in this vast galaxy?  

Who are you in her eyes, tell me?  

Seeing the stars fall but you still want to be there,  

So you know,  

Life is as beautiful as the song we share.
