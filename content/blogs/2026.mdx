## The craziest year 

2025 was a whirlwind of changes. Flew 21 times over 51k miles. It was utter exhaustion at the end - with an illness that has carried over from December 2025 till now. 

I was told last week, "I felt like you've speed ran everyone else's 50 years of life into 10 years." There were some truth to it. 

Spent half a decade learning new things, meeting people, and building endlessly. Running my own startup, in China and in the UK, having different jobs... I barely slept before 10pm. Most of the time I slept at 2-3am and then 5-6 hours of sleep. I am tired. 

I can feel it when I am building [WebKit binding](https://webkit.org/) for [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) right now. My focus, energy level are not the same as it used to be. Reading through [v8-internal](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/deps/v8/include/v8-internal.h) and [v8-isolate](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/deps/v8/include/v8-isolate.h) - I wonder, where is my photo-copy memory? Is this the mental fatigue everyone was telling me about after a couple of years of non-stop building?

The latter half of 2025 - I can see the slope of fatigue hitting on me, like the ferns creeping up the walls, eating me slowly. Sometimes I had to sleep for 12 hours to recover, or more. I was travelling too much, not having my routine, Third Space, hot yoga, not having the abundance of vegetables like I had when I was in London. 

It got even worse when I was in China. Waking up at 11pm, work until 10am the next day and then sleep at 1pm. Because of all the family get-togethers and events, I felt like I was having two full time jobs - they'd wake me up, or ask me to go out together at 11am - my sleep schedule was completely thrown off. 

I was hoping to have some rest when I was in China - didn't expect it to feel like "I was running out of life.".

After I got back to London, the crazy schedule continues. Slack went off every minute, starting at noon every day. I work from lunch time til 2am, with house viewings every day. There were at least 2 days I completely passed out at 4pm. 

I was reminded I haven't seen the sun, or when I see the sun I felt like a ghost. Not having time to work out. 

I couldn't feel love. 

It wasn't just the love towards people. I couldn't feel my love for work, for code, for everything that used to make me feel alive. 

No matter how much money I make, I am not happy. Even if that money puts me on 0.01% percentile in London. 

So I left again. Not the best move, but if I felt like dying, I had to. 

A week after getting my routine back, starting to eat at normal times, going to work out - mom said I looked so much prettier. Bev said the same - I looked calmer and prettier, there was peace in my eyes.  

I wasn't even shipping enough, at least not to my standards. 

I wanted to go back to London - to find the people who make me feel alive again, and myself. He said I am incredibly hot, I was laughing so hard inside, thinking "This is the worst version of me - I don't even know how you'd be able to see me at my best."

I gained a ton of weight that I haven't had for years. 

I know why. 

### Not feeling love is a huge problem

I am the driver of my life. Everything, everyone else is a passenger. I have to be in full control of what's going on and what will happen next. People, things, work - they hop on and ask for a ride, I am glad to have the company, but if I want to keep a good ride, full of fun, joy, and excitement, I need to feel the love. For them, for the world, for myself. 


# Preparing for the next run

Like the lion in hibernation. I need to rest, recharge and prepare for the next run. I don't know what the next run would be yet - and so far none of the opportunities that came to me felt right. 

The question is - my friends all seemed to be able to market themselves and find places where they want to be. But my ideal opportunities don't seem to be coming to me. There are a lot of opportunities that came to me - but none of them felt right. 

If this is a question of "how I market myself", comparing how Alistair, Samnuel, Nicholas (jk he doesn't even market himself) are doing it - there are something missing in those elements. 

Although I can see their marketing is highly focusing on building, marketing what they built. Alistair is slightly less so on social media but rather privately - he is extremely young, well-spoken, and known enough, sometimes also with things they are interested in. 

To build, care about the details relentlessly and talk about the details relentlessly. 


### Finding love again

The way forward is deadly simple. 


Care about myself. 

Care about my mood. If anything seems to become an outlier of my daily routine that I feel an urge to do - there is something about my mood that I am not giving enough attention to and I should. Write it down. 

Sleep early. 

Have a routine. Work out. 

Eat at a normal time. 

WebKit, Datadog, Bun, [Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), [Signal and Systems](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-007-signals-and-systems-spring-2011/)...all my projects - they can come later. 

Love myself first, and give it time. 

Money will always come to find me. 

### 10 years of sprint

The past 12 years was a good ride - from China to Macau, US, Thailand,Australia, Hong Kong, UK, Germany, Austria, France, Singapore...I am tired but fulfilled. 

There will be another 10 years of sprint to go - take my break, recover, and run again.
