I am the bloom await to burgeon for you since winter;<br/>
You are the only burning iron in snow.<br/>
I never have any memories about you;<br/>
My breather's silent echo is true.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've waited, patient and free;<br />
Yearning for someone to let me be me.<br/>
I have said there are flowers unbidden in the world;<br/>
You casted with doubt.<br/>
And said flowers might choose to withhold;<br/>
Just like me.<br/>
<br/>
I am the candle melded into your form. <br/>
You extinguished the fire waiting.<br/>
You knew I had tried the taste of tears.<br/>
All kinds of them.<br/>
<br/>
We shall write a show together, you said;<br/>
A show of me thinking about you only.<br/>
You will mold my essence, dough of my design.<br/>
A version of me guarding your trembling hands.<br/>
<br/>
Are you listening? <br/>
Your heat is running in my vein.<br/>
Is one lifetime enough? <br/>
I am singing the love song of infinite.<br/>
<br/>
I heard tales of life's hardship;<br/>
So let's craft a story of you and me defying gravity.<br/>
I don't think I am thinking about you.<br/>
I am thinking about the tapestry of love all over the sky.<br/>
It's not blood running in your body.<br/>
But my fervent tears, a symphony's sign.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the lock;<br/>
Why do I need keys anyways? <br/>
You have them all.<br/>
<br/>
But you said we need to finish the show,<br/>
A script to be played, untold.<br/>
I always said you don't have a plan.<br/>
You said ain't we all wandering souls?<br/>
I know now.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you exactly? <br/>
In this endless quest of mine.<br/>
Where is everyone? <br/>
Am I but a resounding echo in the valley? <br/>
Or will you ever return, as the first snow bestows?<br/>
<br/>
