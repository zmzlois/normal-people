She came quietly,<br/>
and slowly left in silence.<br/>
The promise at the end didn't bring away loneliness.

The emotions weren't wrong,<br/>
it was the time spent alone gets torturous.<br/>
She said she wouldn't mind solitude,<br/>
as long as there is something she can hold on to.<br/>

The fireworks wouldn't be perfect if they were not at night.<br/>
The memories burnt into ashes, and no one saw the end.<br/>

I am afraid she is being detroyed day by day,<br/>
even if she says she doesn't care.<br/>

The petals are too scared to fall before dark,<br/>
The leaves followed to taste the pain of thorns.<br/>

I no longer scared of the dark,<br/>
I think I am more afraid of being awake.<br/>
