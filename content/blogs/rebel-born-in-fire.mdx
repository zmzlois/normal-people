<hr/>

Is every victory worth writing into a ballad? 

Would the world be different if I tried everything I can? 

What type of howling can tear despair apart? 

What should I do to change my destiny? 

<br/>

Nobody can stop me in this world, 

Even if there was nothing at the end and my body was whole of scars, 

I want to daydream even in the darkest nights. 

<br/>

I want the torch to light up the sky of tomorrow, 

Even if I need to cut out all my backup plans, 

Nigga I will gamble for this fight. 

<br/>

Let the mortals talk,

But I only want to look beyond and forward. 

<br/>

Even if there is no end of the road, no returns, 

My ideals shall not be broken. 

I will walk through the thorns and thousand miles of wind and sand to reach my wonderland. 

<br/>

I want to flip this chaotic world upside down, 

Crushing the fireballs and walls. 

I want to scorch the lies on earth, 

I want to turn my tears and blemish to the strength of my fist, 

Break through the endless nights when we don’t see light. 

<br/>

Free all the caged souls, 

I don’t believe in the rules they said in lore, 

I don’t trust that I’d have the results everyone else had. 

Repeatedly talk about the mandates they made up, 

They told me how to live my life with my head down. 

<br/>

But they forgot I was the rebel born in fire, 

I can flip this chaotic world upside down.
