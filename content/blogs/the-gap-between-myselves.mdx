Memories made up wind,

Desire became dreams,

I stare at the mirror and wonder,

Why does she look normal?

<br/>
Time weaves into a song,

Speechless is me. 

I wore the heavy silence,

only found out there is nothing more to say. 
<br/>
I was zoning out a second ago,

all of a sudden it became nothing.

Growing up showed me the gap between my two selves. 

<br/>
The wind raced to me,

told me it understood my dreams, 

and me let loose in their cuddles. 

<br/>
Memories became sand,

Desire forged the hole, 

I have no alternative but to look at myself. 

<br/>
Time became sand, 

Soul spoke, 

Only the silence was priceless,

swept the struggles in me.

<br/>

Memories made up wind,

Desire became dreams,

Like the ancient poems. 

<br/>

That me in the mirror, 

Like wind, 

Like dreams.
