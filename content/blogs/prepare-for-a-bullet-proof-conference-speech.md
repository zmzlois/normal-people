Recently I gave a speech in [RenderATL 2025](https://renderatl.com/), a conference for developers and designers in Atlanta - and ngl I don't think I did a good job at any sense and I want to look back at what I did wrong and how I can improve for the next time. 


But I think the biggest take away would be: 

## Stop doing presentation driven development 

I know a lot of people were hyped about the idea of "presentation driven development" (not a bad thing to do when you are [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/)) - where you develop your presentation first and then build the product to fit the presentation. 

Bad idea. 

When things are not well defined, thought out, and your ability is too far-fetched from the actual product. 

I'm not saying you should not do it, but you should be careful with it.
