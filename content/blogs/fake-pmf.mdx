The most common symptons of in-pending death after seed funding - why Founders believe they have product market fit when they don't. 

<hr/>

## Outline and bullet points

#### 1. Raised from impressive people

Founders somehow believes that these people, famous VCs or investors are great at choosing companies - if these people chose them that means they must have product market fit or the problem they are trying to solve. 


#### 2. Raising a Series A before Product Market Fit 

It's common nowadays for companies to raise 5-10 million dollars when they don't have something people love yet. What's interesting is instead of focusing on users and products, founders often shift their focus on company building - which is a typical no no. 

#### 3. Magical Thinking

Ignoring the facts and metrics will often trick you into thinking you have product market fit when you don't. For example, not understanding your churn; no understanding your payback period when you acquire a customer. 

#### 4. Lack of strong technical talents

A lot of times people convince themselves that they have product market fit - simply because they don't want to embrace the idea that they might need better engineering, or they might need to improve their product. Improving the product is too hard so it's easier to believe the product is good.

# What you think PMF means might be different from what it actually means

Common misconception: PMF means conceptually we built the product that users want. 

**Reality is it reflects on numbers. What product market fit feels like:**

## Your product is breaking with profitable usage. 

- People come and use your product by word of mouth 

- Advertising channels are working 

- Users are loving it so they are retaining

### Result:

#### 1. Parts of the product that you didn't build to scale is starting to not working. 

- Sometimes the software components

- Sometimes it's operational, human components

One of these will start to break because you didn't build it to scale. 

#### 2. Profitable Usage 

- Users are the type of users you want + provide the economics you want. 

So you are not paying 1k USD to a user that are ever going to give you 1k dollars, or they don't have a three year payback period. 

> Make sure you have both two elements. 



# What are some of the signs you convinced yourself you have Product-Market Fit? 

#### 1. Lots of hiring 

Lots and lots of hiring. Typically Founders who think they have product-market fit - their teams goes from 4 to 12 before you know it. 

#### 2. More business people than engineers

"Oh it's time to scale the sales team. The numbers are not growing so let's hire more sales."


#### 3. No one is looking at numbers

Everyone is doing things by feel or by guess. 

#### 4. Too many nice things

Nice offices. Nice dinners. Nice trips - suddenly you start to spend money on nice things. 

#### 5. Flat grass 

#### 6. Missing your estimate and coming up with excuses to think that's ok 

"I thought we can do this in Q1...do this in July...we didn't hit it...but it's still ok..."


#### 7. Changing your KPIs 

"We used to measure our monthly revenue..but that number is flat lining so now we are changing ot monthly usage." Then you'd **better fucking ask yourself __why__**. Why are you changing KPIs? What's going on here? Did we get our KPI wrong in the beginning? Or does that mean we are actually not progressing the business. 

## How to fix this? 
###### 1. Pick an honest KPI and stick to it. 

1. For SaaS business - the KPI is almost always **the revenue**.

Revenue is of course two components: 
- a. Revenue from new users 
- b. Revenue from retained users

**2. Track your retention carefully.**

If your product is exceptionally good - it's unacceptable that your users are churning. 

**3. Cap-ear burn**

If you are pre-product market fit, you should determine the amount of money that you are willing to spend and burn every month - and stick with it. You need to say to yourself "Until we reach PMF, we are not going to spend more than these amount of money per month."

If we want to spend more than this amount per month, we will be spending our revenue, as opposed to spending the money that we raised. 

> Great way to prevent yourself from fake product-market fit or fake company building. 

**4. Consider raising less money in your seed round (also less equity dilution)**

If you have less money, you'd have less magical thinking and aggressive spending. You have to be a lot of careful about your metrics and numbers, and it can prevent "fake PMF problems".
