Borrow the street light in midnight,

Light up the shadow on bumpy road. 

Borrow the burning sun in summer, 

Melt the coldness that spike my bones. 

<br/>

Borrow the thousand-mile ancient river that runs, 

Send the shambling candle to float afar. 

Borrow the rhythm from past memories, 

Sing the story that can never be told. 

<br/>

He got blew away by wind but he said he didn't fall in love deeply enough.

He was soaked in rain but said he wasn't freezing. 

He was crying in the dark but said he was ok. 

How many people are blinded by endless night-time, 

It shines in his eyes yet he was too afraid to admit. 

<br/>

Borrow the gleam from sunset before we say goodbye, 

Add some illumination to the long rest of life.

Borrow the unforgotten line "We've got time.",

If life made us to be so far apart. 

<br/>

But there will always be something that wind can't tear apart, 

There will always be stains of tears even rain can't wash away.

One day the sun will rise in a random morning, 

Glows the rainbow on two, 

Borrow a place where he could stay. 

Borrow him an ordinary and happy life. 

<br/>

If he ever says he's not afraid of the dark,

I will tell him I will wait for the light no matter how long it takes. 

But he is. 

So the story will never be told.
