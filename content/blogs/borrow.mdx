Borrow the street light in midnight,

Light up the shadow on bumpy road. 

Borrow the burning sun in summer, 

Melt the coldness that spike my bones in this life. 

<br/>

Borrow the thousand-mile ancient river that runs, 

Send the shambling candle to float afar. 

Borrow the rhythm from past memories, 

Sing the story that can never be told. 

<br/>

He got blew away by wind but said he didn't fall in love deeply enough,

He was soaked in rain but said he wasn't freezing. 

How many people are blinded by endless nightscope, 

It shines in his eyes yet he doesn't want to admit. 

<br/>

But there will always be something that wind can't tear apart, 

There will always be stains of tears even rain can't wash away.

One day the sun will rise in a random morning, 

Glows the rainbow on two, 

Borrow a place where he could stay.
