I raised my head and walk towards the moon, 

People laughed and said "You are crazy",

I thought, "How could we be the same".

<br/>

I wore white shirt, 

Yet I still walk through mud. 

I crawled up the rampart to see the what I want to see. 

I crushed my heart several times for a couple lines of truth. 

<br/>

The world. The society. Everything feels like a cave. 

If you born with thorn, do worn them out before you enter the cage. 

Everyone is saying the right thing, 

But I said excuse me let me pass. 

<br/>

Let me get drunk in the palace, 

And read some random poetry.  

Let me pass that mad house with undyed, 

Scoop up moonlight in the pond. 

<br/>

Thanks for everyone's reminder, 

I understood them and I don't want to pretend I will listen. 

Everyone is looking for gold mines, 

Yet I am looking for the moon. 

If the path is different why bother to walk together? 

<br/>

Every heart is flawed, they say. 

I stepped on bramble not because I am not scared, 

it's because I know what I am paying for. 

<br/>

I weigh the pros and cons and still wanting to stand. 

You can live your life and my life is off yours. 

I walk the mud with white because the romance sprinkles around. 

I know what I love and I stand where I stand. 

<br/>

If I still have belief after seeing the dark, 

I will wander at night draping moonlight all over me.
