They all said "You will get scared and chicken feet when you only really start to like them."

I guess it was true. 

She was someone made me realise I am a coward in life. 

The minute I am scared, wanting more, but scared that I can't make it -- I am pulling out. 

But I shouldn't. I really shouldn't. 

It's going to be scary. It's going to make you reveal the real you and understand yourself as the real you. Always will be.

I am a coward. 

I guess my flatmate saw through everything after 5 years of long distance relationship and still going strong. 

He said, "Every other person you have mentioned, 30 seconds in you are inviting me to take a piss out of them together. This one...it just feels like there is more to it. I don't know. It feels different. You are finally confused and looking for help."

Like every autistic kids, once the emotion gets intense, we shut out. We stop processing what it is and unable to communicate. Because there is too much to it, and we are a perfect machine to reason with machines, yet not human emotions. 

Just face it. If I know where will we end, doesn't matter how long it takes, we will get there, as long as we are together. 

I still can't process how I think and how I feel, but I only have one thing to say, 


"I am a coward. Will you forgive me? I want to be with you, regardless how long it takes for us to be together. I want to be with you."

I invited you to jump a cliff. There is no room for fainted heart. 


I don't want you to jump alone. 

I am sorry.

I have always been scared of "relying on someone", and boom one day they turn their back to me, "you don't deserve it." Any form of "reliance" easily got me scared. 

Love is addition. It is how it should be. I should welcome addition to come in like how it is. 

What's the worst thing could happen?
