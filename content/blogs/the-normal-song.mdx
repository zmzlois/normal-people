Twelve years passed, I wrote a letter to an old friend from home,  

Everything has flown through time, both joy and gloom.  

The road ahead is longer than the one I've walked,  

Yet I have no one to share my thoughts.  

<br/>

I took the pen but didn't know where to start,  

The bell rang at sunset, breaking my heart.  

I only dare to ask how's the wind in spring,  

Afraid to speak deeper.  

<br/>

I dreamt of the old days,  

Saw our village when I opened the window's gaze.  

We talked about everything when we were young,  

We watched the galaxy, side by side we clung.  

<br/>

The grass has grown brown,  

And people from the past still seem to gather round.  

I thought I saw gods when I closed my eyes,  

Sitting under trees, listening to leaves' whispers.  

Moving on from the bad and good,  

As we always understood.  

<br/>

Peach flowers fell, many springs and falls have passed,  

I hold the dearest memories in my dreams that last.  

I spent a long life travel around and always be someone else's guest,  

And we still live in different worlds, never at rest.  

<br/>

I know the floors are covered in flowers, so what?  

I know the sun rises and falls, so what?  

None of them are attainable,  

Lucky that they're just normal things in life,  

So I wrote a normal song as tribute to our strife.  

<br/>
<hr/>

<br/>

I am just killing time in peaceful years,  

At the end I can't see through the future's fears.  

I can shield myself from wind and rain,  

But how do I shield from the goodbyes that never return? 

<br/>

Go to the stadium on horses,  

The lanterns light up the sky in courses.  

Nobody saw the ups and downs, separation and companionship,  

We all hide our sorrows behind friendship's grip.  

<br/>

Peach flowers fell, many springs and falls have passed,  

I hold the dearest memories in my dreams that last.  

I spent a long life waking up to be someone else's guest,  

And we still live in different worlds, never at rest.  

<br/>

I know the floors are covered in flowers, so what?  

I know the sun rises and falls, so what?  

None of them are attainable,  

Lucky that they're just normal things in life,  

So I wrote a normal song as tribute to our strife.  

<br/>
<hr/>

So you understand that someone will never understand you,  

You fled from the world yet never changed your ideal.  

How many people having fun at dinner,  

Yet looking down through wine glasses with sorrow's shimmer?  

<br/>

I know the floors are covered in flowers, so what?  

I know the sun rises and falls, so what?  

None of them are attainable,  

Lucky that they're just normal things in life,  

So I wrote a normal song as tribute to our strife.
