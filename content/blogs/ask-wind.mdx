[verse]

Thoughts turn into wind, ripping through the sky,

Crashing into my dreams.

The debates of reunion and parting,

The unsolved mystery of separation’s meaning.

<br/>
Why did you leave without a reason?

Your all-seeing eyes missed the hesitation in mine.

<br/>

Still trapped in your dream, unable to awaken,

My wounded body remains unmended.

I rush to ask you, ask you—

Did I leave anything in your mind?

<br/>

I haven't got time to ask where the wind will take me,

Over deserts or buried in valleys…

I have one question, question—

Where can I find you?

<br/>

Thoughts turn into wind, ripping through the sky,

Crashing into my dreams.

The debates of reunion and parting,

The unsolved mystery of separation’s meaning.

Why did you leave without a reason?

Your all-seeing eyes missed the hesitation in mine.

<br/>

[rap/hook]

Without you, am I still myself?

Should life turn right or left now?

At time’s end, only ashes remain;

No spark lingers in the soul’s depths.

What’s left between us?

Frozen memories, fading gray.

Your absence hollows everything—

A shell remains, all erased.

The fine wine you gave was poison.

Better to have parted ways early.

Burn this tapestry with fire,

Swallow the bitterness I couldn’t bear,

Taste the joy I never shared.

I ask the wind, “Where do you rest?”

But it blows out my guiding light.

<br/>


[verse2]

Still trapped in your dream, unable to awaken,

My wounded body remains unmended.

I rush to ask you, ask you—

Did I leave anything in your mind?

<br/>

I haven't got time to ask where the wind will take me,

Over deserts or buried in valleys…

I have one question, question—

Where can I find you?

Too many questions, words too sharp—

No time to ask why you left.

Like a fish escaping the net,

Falling into ruins.

No desire to be foes;

The deep sea isn’t the only truth.

<br/>

You always wondered—now I’ll tell you:

I was sand sinking into the abyss, carried by wind.

But I ignored how grains carve wounds,

Reborn, choosing to merge as one.

Still trapped in your dream, unable to awaken…
