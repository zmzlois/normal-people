The lyrics are a bit cringe but it's a good song.

I might have some sickness trapped me in nightmares. 

The more I want to forget, the more I want to see you. 

How to explain to my lost memories? 

The most grandure of all is to have you in my life, although shortly. 

I am back to solitude again where I listen to old songs played by the piano,

Thinking about going back. 

<hr/>

I couldn't get over the past in midnight. 

I couldn't resist my addiction about you, 

Yet losing myself. 

You are like my melatonin comforting my nerves. 

I couldn't accept the fact that you are gone, 

I couldn't listen to anyone's advice, 

Stubbornly piecing the memories about you, 

Because I am addicted. 

<hr/>

I am scared of the dark, when dawn slowly approaches. 

I put the song about you on repeat,  

But I still feel sorry. 

I only learnt the lesson after I lost you. 

I want to escape from the city you live in, 

Because the city smells like you. 

<hr/>

I couldn't get past the memories in midnight, 

I couldn't accept the fact that you are gone,  

Because I am addicted to you. 

<hr/>

Couldn't find you during insomnia, 

Vaguely hear your voice, 

Walking back and forth in the maze, 

I couldn't see the future, 

But the memories in the past are still vivid. 

<hr/>

You are like my melatonin comforting my nerves. 

I couldn't accept the fact that you are gone, 

Because I am addicted to you.
