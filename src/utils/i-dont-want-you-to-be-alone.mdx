description: Bearing the cruelty from the world.
---

I printed extra copies of our album so you can have one extra,

I prepared one more sweater so you can be warmer in winter,

But how can I reserve body warmth when you are alone?

<br/>

I don't want you to see people comes and goes. 

I don't want you to walk alone in rainy days.

I don't want you to bear the cruelty of this world by yourself.
